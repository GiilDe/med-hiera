pip install requirements.txt
```

## Using

### Data
In order to recreate this experiment you first to build the datasets "cocktail". 
Download the following datasets - 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database?resource=download

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andyczhao/covidx-cxr2

https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/chestx-ray14

https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018161

https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/brats2020/data.html

Run the file ```datasets/separate_train_test.py``` to separate the chestx-ray14 data into train, test, validation1 and validation2 datasets.
### MAE

```python
python mae_training.py --save_model_name "some model name.pth"...
```

### Classification

```python
python classification_training.py --pretrained_path "some model name.pth" --save_model_name "some other model name.pth"...
```


### Test

```python
python test_set_evaluation.py --pretrained_path "some other model name.pth"  ...
```

Note that this repo works with wandb, a link should be outputted in the start of each run (mae/classification/test), click to view run metrics.

### Other files
For sweeping see ```init_classification_sweep.py``` and ```init_mae_sweep.py``` for classification and mae respectively. Also, ```run_classification_sweep.py``` and ```run_mae_sweep.py``` for running the sweeps.
```compute_dataset_mean_std.py``` computes the mean and std for a dataset, used for normalization.
```utils.py``` contains implementation for our Dataset class.
```datasets/analyse_datasets.py``` prints a summary of each dataset, its size and image type and dimensions.
